    <p>Delicious cheesecake with caramel with Cinnamon Toast Crunch crust</p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
    <li>12 graham crackers</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar, divided</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled, plus more for greasing pan</li>
    <li>4 (8-ounce) packages cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>4 large eggs</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
    <li>1/2 prepared dulce de leche</li>
    <li>Flaky sea salt, for garnish</li>
</ul>
<h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Wrap 3 layers of aluminum foil around the outside of a 9-inch springform pan with 3-inch-high sides. Grease pan with butter. Combine graham crackers, 1/4 cup sugar, and salt in a food processor and pulse until crumbly. Add melted butter, and pulse until moistened. Press crumb mixture evenly onto bottom and 1 1/2 inches up sides of prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven just until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Let cool completely. Reduce oven temperature to 325°F.</li>
        <li>In an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat cream cheese on medium speed until fluffy. Add vanilla and remaining 1 1/4 cups sugar, and beat until combined. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating until well combined after each addition. Add sour cream, and beat until smooth, about 35 seconds. Measure 1 cup filling, and place in a medium bowl. Add dulce de leche to filling in bowl; whisk until dulce de leche is fully incorporated into filling. Pour plain cheesecake filling into cooled crust. Drizzle dulce de leche filling over top. Using a knife, swirl to create a marbled effect.</li>
        <li>Set cheesecake in a large baking pan. Add hot water to baking pan to come 1 inch up side of springform pan. Bake until almost set (the center will move slightly when the pan is gently shaken) but not puffed, about 1 hour and 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let cheesecake cool at room temperature 2 hours. Cover loosely with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until completely cooled, at least 6 hours or preferably overnight. Garnish with sea salt, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
